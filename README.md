# EB3EWQ Electronic Keyer

The EB3EWQ Electr√≤nic Keyer is a project espeally designed for Amateur Radio. Consist in a single board containing electronics and the keyer itsef. Using printed touch sensor, it provides a high speed keying, because there's no mechanical parts that affect the operator speed.

This project contents:

  - The source code for programming the ATtiny
  - The schematic diagram for eagle cad (.sch)
  - The PCB design for eagle cad (.brd)

Program is uploaded to ATtiny using Arduino IDE. Can be tested in Arduino UNO board.

TODO: 

  - Program a monitor output, already wired in the board.
  - Provide a way to program tone monitor output, adjusting at init state.
